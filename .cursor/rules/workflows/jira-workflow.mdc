# Jira Workflow

Invoke with: *"get my tickets"*, *"start working on CNV-XXX"*, *"what should I work on"*, *"show sprint issues"*

This workflow uses the Jira MCP server to help you manage tickets and track work.

---

## 1. Available Jira Commands

### Finding Tickets

**Get My Assigned Tickets**
```
"Show my assigned tickets"
"What tickets are assigned to me?"
"Get my current work items"
```
→ Uses `jira_search` with JQL: `assignee = currentUser() AND status != Done`

**Get Current Sprint Tickets**
```
"Show current sprint tickets"
"What's in this sprint?"
```
→ Uses `jira_get_sprint_issues`

**Search for Specific Tickets**
```
"Find tickets about VM migration"
"Search for CNV issues with label 'ui'"
"Find open bugs in CNV project"
```
→ Uses `jira_search` with appropriate JQL

**Get Ticket Details**
```
"Get details for CNV-12345"
"What is CNV-12345 about?"
"Show me ticket CNV-12345"
```
→ Uses `jira_get_issue`

---

## 2. Starting Work on a Ticket

### Full Workflow
```
"Start working on CNV-12345"
```

This will:
1. Fetch ticket details (summary, description, acceptance criteria)
2. Show you the requirements
3. Transition ticket to "In Progress" (if applicable)
4. Suggest where to start in the codebase

### Understanding the Ticket

When you start on a ticket, I will:
- Summarize the requirements
- Identify acceptance criteria
- List related tickets (blockers, depends on)
- Suggest relevant code areas to look at
- Identify potential risks or questions

---

## 3. Common JQL Queries

### By Status
```jql
# My in-progress work
assignee = currentUser() AND status = "In Progress"

# Ready for development
status = "Ready for Dev" AND project = CNV

# In code review
status = "Code Review" AND assignee = currentUser()
```

### By Type
```jql
# Bugs only
issuetype = Bug AND project = CNV AND status != Done

# Stories assigned to me
issuetype = Story AND assignee = currentUser()

# Epics in current project
issuetype = Epic AND project = CNV
```

### By Time
```jql
# Updated in last 7 days
updated >= -7d AND assignee = currentUser()

# Created this week
created >= startOfWeek() AND project = CNV

# Due soon
duedate <= 7d AND duedate >= 0d
```

### By Label/Component
```jql
# UI-related tickets
labels = ui AND project = CNV

# Specific component
component = "Virtual Machines" AND status != Done
```

## 4. Updating Tickets

### Add a Comment
```
"Add comment to CNV-12345: Started investigating the issue"
"Comment on CNV-12345 with my findings"
```
→ Uses `jira_add_comment`

### Update Status
```
"Move CNV-12345 to Code Review"
"Transition CNV-12345 to Done"
"Mark CNV-12345 as blocked"
```
→ Uses `jira_transition_issue`

### Log Work
```
"Log 2 hours on CNV-12345"
"Add worklog to CNV-12345: 1h 30m investigating"
```
→ Uses `jira_add_worklog`

---

## 5. Ticket Analysis

When I fetch a ticket, I analyze:

### Requirements Understanding
- **Summary**: What is the high-level goal?
- **Description**: Detailed requirements and context
- **Acceptance Criteria**: What defines "done"?
- **Attachments**: Mockups, designs, screenshots

### Context
- **Epic/Parent**: Larger feature this belongs to
- **Related Issues**: Blockers, dependencies, related work
- **Comments**: Discussion and clarifications
- **History**: Previous attempts or related changes

### Planning
- **Affected Areas**: Which parts of codebase to modify
- **Risks**: Potential challenges or unknowns
- **Questions**: Things to clarify before starting
- **Approach**: Suggested implementation strategy

## 6. Workflow Examples

### Daily Standup Prep
```
"What did I work on yesterday and what's blocked?"
```
→ Searches for recently updated tickets and blocked items

### Sprint Planning
```
"Show unassigned tickets in current sprint"
"What's the priority order for my tickets?"
```

### Starting a New Feature
```
"Start working on CNV-12345"
```
→ Full ticket analysis and codebase suggestions

### Completing Work
```
"I'm done with CNV-12345, prepare it for review"
```
→ Adds completion comment, transitions to Code Review

### End of Day
```
"Update my tickets with today's progress"
```
→ Helps add comments to active tickets

## 7. Integration with Development

### From Ticket to Code
1. "Start working on CNV-12345"
2. I fetch and analyze the ticket
3. I suggest relevant files and components
4. I help implement the feature
5. I help write tests
6. "Prepare PR for CNV-12345"
7. I help create PR with ticket reference

### Ticket in PR Description
When creating PRs, I will:
- Link to the Jira ticket
- Reference ticket number in title
- Include ticket summary in description
- Follow PR template

---

## 8. Tips

### Effective Queries
- Be specific: "Show bugs assigned to me" vs "show issues"
- Use project codes: "CNV-12345" not just "12345"
- Specify status when relevant: "open bugs" vs "all bugs"

### Staying Updated
- Check ticket comments before starting work
- Look at related tickets for context
- Check if ticket was updated since you last looked

### Communication
- Add comments when starting/finishing work
- Document blockers in ticket comments
- Tag relevant people in comments when needed
