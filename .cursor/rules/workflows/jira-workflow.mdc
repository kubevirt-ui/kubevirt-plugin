# Jira Workflow

Invoke with: *"get my tickets"*, *"show sprint issues"*, *"update ticket"*, *"search jira"*

This workflow covers Jira MCP operations. For the full development workflow (ticket to PR), see `feature-development.mdc`.

---

## 1. Finding Tickets

**Get My Assigned Tickets**
```
"Show my assigned tickets"
```
→ Uses `jira_search` with JQL: `assignee = currentUser() AND status != Done`

**Get Current Sprint Tickets**
```
"Show current sprint tickets"
```
→ Uses `jira_get_sprint_issues`

**Search for Specific Tickets**
```
"Find open bugs in CNV project"
```
→ Uses `jira_search` with appropriate JQL

**Get Ticket Details**
```
"Get details for CNV-12345"
```
→ Uses `jira_get_issue`

---

## 2. Common JQL Queries

### By Status
```jql
assignee = currentUser() AND status = "In Progress"
status = "Ready for Dev" AND project = CNV
status = "Code Review" AND assignee = currentUser()
```

### By Type
```jql
issuetype = Bug AND project = CNV AND status != Done
issuetype = Story AND assignee = currentUser()
issuetype = Epic AND project = CNV
```

### By Time
```jql
updated >= -7d AND assignee = currentUser()
created >= startOfWeek() AND project = CNV
duedate <= 7d AND duedate >= 0d
```

### By Label/Component
```jql
labels = ui AND project = CNV
component = "Virtual Machines" AND status != Done
```

---

## 3. Updating Tickets

**Add a Comment**
```
"Add comment to CNV-12345: Started investigating the issue"
```
→ Uses `jira_add_comment`

**Update Status**
```
"Move CNV-12345 to Code Review"
"Mark CNV-12345 as blocked"
```
→ Uses `jira_transition_issue`

**Log Work**
```
"Log 2 hours on CNV-12345"
```
→ Uses `jira_add_worklog`

---

## 4. Ticket Analysis

When fetching a ticket, analyze:

- **Summary**: High-level goal
- **Description**: Detailed requirements and context
- **Acceptance Criteria**: What defines "done"
- **Related Issues**: Blockers, dependencies, related work
- **Comments**: Discussion and clarifications
- **Affected Areas**: Which parts of codebase to modify
- **Risks**: Potential challenges or unknowns

## 5. MCP Tool Reference

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `jira_search` | Find tickets with JQL |
| `jira_get_issue` | Get ticket details |
| `jira_add_comment` | Add comments |
| `jira_transition_issue` | Change status |
| `jira_add_worklog` | Log time |
| `jira_update_issue` | Update fields |
| `jira_get_sprint_issues` | Get sprint issues |

Tools are called automatically when you make requests. Just describe what you want in natural language.

## 6. Tips

- Be specific: "Show bugs assigned to me" vs "show issues"
- Use project codes: "CNV-12345" not just "12345"
- Check ticket comments before starting work
- Add comments when starting/finishing work
- Document blockers in ticket comments
