## Focus Areas

### 1. Accessibility - Perceivable

**Text Alternatives**
- Images have meaningful alt text

- Complex graphics have descriptions
- SVGs have title/desc or aria-label

**Color & Contrast**
- Text meets contrast ratios (4.5:1 normal, 3:1 large)
- Not relying on color alone to convey information
- Status indicators have text/icon in addition to color
- Focus indicators visible
- Error states not just red color

**Content Structure**
- Logical heading hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3)
- Lists used for list content
- Tables have headers
- Landmark regions defined
- Reading order makes sense

**Responsive & Scalable**
- Text resizable to 200% without loss
